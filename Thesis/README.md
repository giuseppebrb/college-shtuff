# Thesis

I graduated in March 2017 :mortar_board: and my thesis was about designing and developing a web service for a [personal health record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_health_record) based on the HL7 standard [FHIR](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/).
This folder contains slides I used for my final presentation along with the thesis in pdf format.

Here's the video of the presentation in Italian:
