# Programming fundamentals II + Lab
## Algorithms and data structures

In this directory you'll find laboratory exercises and solved examination tests for the exam [Programming fundamentals II + Lab](http://www.di.uniba.it/~malerba/courses/asd/index.htm) a computer science course at [Informatica e Tecnologie per la Produzione del Software](http://informatica.di.uniba.it/laurea_produzione3/index.htm) • [Università degli Studi di Bari](http://www.uniba.it/).

In `laboratory` folder there are various implementations of data structures and algorithms explained during laboratory lessons held by Professor D. Malerba.

In `exams` folder instead there are packages containing different examination tests and problems which I solved in order to train for the final laboratory examination.
Official laboratory examination problems are available [here](http://www.di.uniba.it/~malerba/courses/asd/index.htm).
